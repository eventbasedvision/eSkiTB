# Tiny examples

This folder is for a few-MB smoke-test samples so users can verify loaders without fetching the full dataset.

Suggested contents (to be added):
- `sample_events.npy` or `sample_events.png`: a short window of accumulated events.
- `sample_annotation.json`: matching annotation in the schema used in `data/annotations/format.md`.
- Optional `sample_rgb.png`: paired RGB frame if you support fusion.

Keep samples small (<10 MB) to stay GitHub-friendly.
